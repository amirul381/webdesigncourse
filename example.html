<p>Maximillian Alvarez:  We’re here in Union Park, in Chicago. It’s Thursday, Aug. 22, and just hours from now, the final night of the Democratic National Convention is going to kick off. Kamala Harris, who’s formally accepted the party’s nomination to take on Donald Trump in the general elections, is going to speak.

    And in just a short time, the Coalition to March on the DNC will be leading their final march of the week, starting here at Union Park. This is also the site where the march on the DNC on Monday took place, within sight and sound of the United Center, which is within a mile from where we are currently standing.
    
    I’m standing here right now with the great Eman Abdelhadi, a writer, an activist based here in Chicago, who’s been doing incredible coverage all week for our amazing partners at In These Times magazine.</p>

<p>Colonel John Chivington (l. 1821-1894) had actually led his men against a village of Cheyenne and Arapaho in full compliance with the policies of Governor John Evans (l. 1814-1897) who had offered safety to peaceful tribes, friendly toward the US government, who might, therefore, fall prey to the hostile bands that were raiding wagon trains and settlements in the Colorado region. Black Kettle (l. c. 1803-1868), chief of the Southern Cheyenne, and Chief Niwot (also known as Left Hand, l. c. 1825-1864) of the Southern Arapaho led their people to Sand Creek as directed by Evans. Most had surrendered their weapons at Fort Lyon and the village was primarily occupied by women, children, and the elderly.</p>
